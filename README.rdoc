Do you just have to have a local copy of all of your repositories?  Or all of your favorite developer's repositories?  Well now you can!  Well, you always could, but now you can do it with one quick command.  Well, maybe you could do that before too.  Whatever.

== To Do

- replace the curl command with a Net::HTTP or something so can control failures.  If the user no longer exists, it return HTML rather than json which causes parsing failure.  (Same happens when the developer mistypes a username!)
